    <h1>CRISPR for Cancer Therapy</h1>
    <p>We are developing RNA-guided CRISPR systems as programmable tools for selectively eliminating cancer cells. These systems can target specific mutations that are undruggable by conventional therapeutics, offering a new avenue for targeted and precise cancer treatments.</p>

    <h1>Bacterial Defence Systems</h1>
    <p>To discover new conditionally activatable enzymes and effectors, we study how bacteria defend themselves against viral infection (phages). These systems offer a rich source of diverse enzymes with unique biochemical activities that could be harnessed in medicine and biotechnology.</p>

    <h1>Gene Delivery Methods</h1>
    <p>Efficient delivery remains a key hurdle both <em>in vivo</em> and <em>ex vivo</em>. We engineer and apply state of the art gene delivery technologies to introduce nucleic acids and proteins into difficult-to-transfect cells. Our work also includes fundamental studies of intracellular trafficking and delivery efficiency to understant the rate limiting steps.</p>
